The Leader Programme part funded the project at a cost of €100,000 and      Cavan Tidy Town Committee and Cavan Town Council provided the balance.   </p><p>This site was developed as a natural habitat to protect and preserve native plants  and wildlife here at the lake and also to protect the heritage associated with the lake.  Development we see here is stage 1 of the development of the lake.   </p><p>A further development or stage 2 is under negotiation and it is hoped that this  will provide a walkway continuously around the banks of our lake.   Work completed in stage 1 was undertaken by the construction company Shaffrey’s of  County Meath and the landscape architect was Dara Hillard from County Wexford.   </p><p>The development and work carried out here has been shortlisted for the prestigious  Chamber’s Ireland Award in the category of Sustainable Environment.   </p><p>The tour was originally planned to be self guiding and information boards are  located throughout the site for your convenience. </p>',

But all species living here are native to Cavan and have lived here happily at the lake for many years.  </p> <p>If we look to the side verges of the footpath we can see that the grass is only partially cut one metre from the edge.   This is done on purpose and again it is to provide cover and a more natural habitat for the local animals that live here. </p> <p>Some of the animals that may be seen at the lake are show on this concrete cast with footprints to your left.

It was reportable seen by locals and visitors alike and the legend grew until a local man described as living a stone’s throw away from the lake caught a massive 40 pound pike here at the lake. </p> <p>It is believed that a local chicken hatchery or factory located on the back shores of the lake was disposing of weak and dead chicks into the lake and this particular fish been continuously feed on fresh chicken had grown to this enormous size. </p> <p>The story is just one of the many legends and folklore stories associated with our lake.</p>',

It is said that the origins of Cavan Town are found at the bottom of the Green Lake. </p> <p>This statement can be backed up from evidence found in local historical accounts.  In the ecclesiastical annals of the Diocese of Kilmore dated 1629, it states that there was a settlement located at this site. Also we read from William Prior Moore’s account in 1859 that a pair of giant antlers were found in deposits on the north eastern banks of the lake.  He tells us of an extensive search being carried for a skeleton from this mighty beast but none ever being found.  Putting these two pieces of information together we can see that there was a settlement or dwelling of some kind on or near the Green Lake.  </p> <p>Incidentally if these 11 foot antlers were ever located again, as they were not recovered at the time from the lake, they would have been the second largest site of antlers ever found in Ireland.</p> <p>The most probable type of dwelling located here on the lake would have been a crannog.  Crannogs were often built on manmade islands in middles of lakes and rivers and would have offered protection to the inhabitants and livestock of the dwelling.  Cattle raids were very common in Ireland from the Iron Age’s right up to the 15th century and crannogs were used for both people and cattle.  </p> <p>A crannog built on an island was first built by driving long poles into the water and then a platform was created on top for the dwelling and pins for livestock to be erected.  Many crannogs had secret path known only by family members.  These paths were stones or wooden poles driven under water and never in a straight line.  The family members would know where to step, whether to left, right or forward, but anyone trying to follow would fall into the water and to a watery grave. </p> <p>When we think that the origins of Cavan town are located underneath a lake this seems very unlikely to us today.  But the lake was a lot smaller in years gone by, during the 19th century the Dublin road which we see here in front of us was not here.  This road was built in the 1820’s and it was said that the great Irish Statesman Daniel O’ Connell visited Cavan in 1822 and that his carriage had to be hauled over rough ground on the unfinished new Dublin road.  </p> <p>This new road changed the economic life of Cavan town dramatically turning it into a stage post stop and allowing exports to travel to and from Dublin with much more ease.  But in order to built this new road the lake had to be moved and so an engineer by the name of Narrick came to Cavan to built what is now known as an Alt.  </p> <p>This alt cut through the hills and the lake drained from Upper Annagelliffe to Lower Annagelliffe giving us the lake that we see here today.  The alt was 40 feet deep and locals said that it created a waterfall causing the lake to move over night.  Narrick later stayed in Cavan and in fact his descendents opened a public house here in Cavan town.</p>',

Of the ghost stories and folklore associated with the lake my favourite would have to be the one of the ghost coffins floating across the lake and the story of St. Brigid’s well located on the far side of the lake under an oak tree on Boylan’s Hill.  This well is said to have the cure of warts.</p> <p>Not all story’s associated with the lake are fun, the lake has a double tragedy. Two young cousins who were training to be priests locally here in Cavan Town drowned here in 1870.  They had gone swimming for the afternoon and had gotten into trouble on their return to the bank. Sadly both cousins were lost and are buried in Annagelliffe cemetery overlooking the Green Lake.  </p> <p>We invite you to now sit and read some of our local folklore.</p>',
